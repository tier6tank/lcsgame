according to index instead of ID number.

* Made presidential veto impossible in extreme-view cases.

* Added addlocationname(locationst *loc) and used it to print business front names instead of location names in some places.

* Added loadinitfile() and used it to handle an init file with key changes.

General porting note:

I use verase() instead of erase() in the STL vector because erase() conflicts with
a macro in PDCurses.  It's also possible that they are fighting over clear().
